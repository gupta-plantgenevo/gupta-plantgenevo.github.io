### **About me:**
I am currently a faculty fellow at the Ashoka University in Sonipat, India. I am interested in everything plants, but one area that deeply motivates me is understanding how plants adapts and evolves, especially when they are faced with stressful conditions.  

Before joining Ashoka in February, 2025, I was a postdoctoral research associate with [Dr. Michael Purugganan](https://puruggananlab.org/) at the New York University, New York. During my time in Michael's lab, my main area of focus was understanding rice's response to salinity stress.  

I did my Ph.D at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor with [Dr. Regina Baucom](https://baucomlab.wordpress.com/) to map phenotype to genotype in *Ipomoea* using approaches from quantitative and population genetics.
